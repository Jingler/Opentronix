Opentronix
==========

Opentronix is a micro-social platform. It helps people to exchange short messages over the web.

It is initially based on a software called Sharetronix. As they changed their license from AGPL
to a proprietary license, we where forced to fork the project. Opentronix is based on the the
last release of Sharetronix that has been released as Free Software.
